## 5-stage Pipeline Emulation

The `educore-pipelined` variant of ASim includes a datapath diagram
for a classic 5-stage pipelined mircoarchitecture (see figure at the
bottom of this page).  After each step of the emulation, the diagram
is annotated with the register and signal values from each pipeline
stage.
